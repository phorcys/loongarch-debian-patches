+Description: <short summary of the patch>
+ TODO: Put a short summary on the line above and replace this paragraph
+ with a longer explanation of this change. Complete the meta-information
+ with other relevant fields (see below for details). To make it easier, the
+ information below has been extracted from the changelog. Adjust it or drop
+ it.
+ .
+ rust-nix (0.26.1-3) unstable; urgency=medium
+ .
+   * Team upload.
+   * Package nix 0.26.1 from crates.io using debcargo 2.6.0
+   * Tolerate socket returning EAFNOSUPPORT in some tests, so the rest of the
+     tests can be run on the Debian s390x porterbox.
+   * Tolerate no dropped packets in test_recvmsg_rxq_ovfl on s390x, this seems
+     to happen on debci but not the porterbox, so I can't really debug it
+     further.
